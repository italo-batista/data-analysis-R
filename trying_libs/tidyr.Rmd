### Tidying messy datasets

Real datasets can, and often do, violate the three precepts of tidy data in almost every way imaginable. The five most common problems with messy dataset:

- Column headers are values, not variable names.
- Multiple variables are stored in one column.
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
- Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
- A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

Surprisingly, most messy datasets, including types of messiness not explicitly described above, can be tidied with a small set of tools: gathering, separating and spreading.
